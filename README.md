## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to edit or refactor the VBA code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information. Then we will determine whether refactoring the code was successfully made the VBA script run faster. A written analysis that explains the finding will be presented. Refactoring is a fundamental part of the coding process. You're making the code more efficient with fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
